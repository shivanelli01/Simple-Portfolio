This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my skills, projects, achievements, and contact details in a simple and responsive design.

I created this project from scratch, and for some technical support (such as design tips and code optimization), I also leveraged AI-assisted tools.
